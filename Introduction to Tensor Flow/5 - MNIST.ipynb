        "# MNIST Classifier\r\n",
        "The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning. It was created by \"re-mixing\" the samples from NIST's original datasets. The creators felt that since NIST's training dataset was taken from American Census Bureau employees, while the testing dataset was taken from American high school students, it was not well-suited for machine learning experiments. Furthermore, the black and white images from NIST were normalized to fit into a 28x28 pixel bounding box and anti-aliased, which introduced grayscale levels.\r\n",

        "## Objective\r\n",
        "Write an MNIST classifier that trains to 99% accuracy or above, and does it without a fixed number of epochs -- i.e. you should stop training once you reach that level of accuracy.\r\n",
        "\r\n",
        "Some notes:\r\n",
        "1. It should succeed in less than 10 epochs, so it is okay to change epochs= to 10, but nothing larger\r\n",
        "2. When it reaches 99% or greater it should print out the string \"Reached 99% accuracy so cancelling training!\"\r\n",
        "3. If you add any additional variables, make sure you use the same names as the ones used in the class\r\n",
