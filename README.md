This Repository Contains Solution to the Assignments of the Tensorflow in Practice Specialization from [deeplearning.ai](https://www.deeplearning.ai/) on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice) taught by [*Laurence Moroney*](https://www.coursera.org/instructor/lmoroney).

TensorFlow is one of the most in-demand and popular open-source deep learning frameworks available today. The DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program taught me applied machine learning skills with TensorFlow so I can build and train powerful models.

In this hands-on, four-course Professional Certificate program, I have learned the necessary tools to build scalable AI-powered applications with TensorFlow. After finishing this program, I am able to apply your new TensorFlow skills to a wide range of problems and projects. This program can help me prepare for the Google TensorFlow Certificate exam and bring me one step closer to achieving the Google TensorFlow Certificate.

In the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Professional Certificate program, I got hands-on experience through 16 Python programming assignments. By the end of this program, you will be ready to:

- Build and train neural networks using TensorFlow
- Improve your network’s performance using convolutions as you train it to identify real-world images
- Teach machines to understand, analyze, and respond to human speech with natural language processing systems
- Process text, represent sentences as vectors, and train a model to create original poetry!

To achieve this, this program includes following courses:

1. Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
2. Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
3. Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
4. Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
